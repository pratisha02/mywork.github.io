    <p>
    A domesticated fowl, the chicken (Gallus gallus domesticus) is a subspecies of the red junglefowl. Chickens are the most prevalent and widely distributed domestic animals, with a population of more than 19 billion in 2011. They outnumber any other bird or domestic animal on the planet. Humans generally raise chickens as a source of food, eating both their flesh and eggs.
    </p>
   
    <h4>Terminology</h4>
    <p>
    Adult male chickens above the age of one year are known as cocks in the United Kingdom and Ireland, but roosters in the United States, Australia, and Canada. Cockerels are males who are less than a year old. Capons are roosters that have been castrated (surgical and chemical castration are now illegal in some parts of the world). In the egg-laying industry, a pullet becomes a hen when she begins to lay eggs at 16 to 20 weeks of age, whereas in the egg-laying industry, a pullet becomes a hen when she begins to lay eggs at 16 to 20 weeks of age. Chook /tk/ is a general term used in Australia and New Zealand (and occasionally in the United Kingdom) to denote animals of all ages and genders.
    </p>
    
    <h4>General biology and habitat</h4>
    <p>
    The adult rooster can be identified from the hen by his bigger comb in some breeds.
    Chickens are omnivores, meaning they eat everything. They scratch at the earth in the wild to look for seeds, insects, and even larger animals like lizards, small snakes, and baby mice.
